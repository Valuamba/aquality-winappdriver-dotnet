### Overview

This package is a library designed to simplify your work with WinAppDriver, aimed to control Windows application using Selenium WebDriver API.

You've got to use this set of methods, related to most common actions performed with windows application elements.

Most of performed methods are logged using NLog, so you can easily see a history of performed actions in your log.

We use interfaces where is possible, so you can implement your own version of target interface with no need to rewrite other classes.
